# DWIN_LK4Pro

Screen firmware for Longer LK4 Pro. should also work with Alfawise U30 although the boot screen has the Longer3D logo.
I did not test with the LK5 Pro. Since this is a similar printer as the LK4 Pro except for print dimensions, it may work also.

Only use this screen firmware with this version of Marlin https://github.com/Guizz27/Marlin---Longer-LKx-Pro
